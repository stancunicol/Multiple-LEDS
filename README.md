# ðŸš¦ Arduino Project: Traffic Light with LEDs
This project demonstrates how to control three LEDs (red, yellow, and green) using an Arduino UNO board. The LEDs are connected to digital pins and can be used to simulate a basic traffic light system.

# ðŸ§° Required Components
1 x Arduino UNO board

1 x Breadboard

3 x LEDs (red, yellow, green)

3 x Resistors (220Î© recommended)

Jumper wires

USB cable for Arduino

# ðŸ”Œ Circuit Description
The red LED is connected to pin 11

The yellow LED is connected to pin 10

The green LED is connected to pin 9

Each LED is connected in series with a resistor to protect it from overcurrent.

The negative (shorter) leg of each LED is connected to the ground rail.

The ground (GND) and 5V from the Arduino are connected to the breadboard rails.

# ðŸ§  How It Works
Each LED can be turned on and off through Arduino digital pins. The Arduino can be programmed to turn them on in sequence, simulating a traffic light (red â†’ yellow â†’ green â†’ red...).
